# Level 26

## Objetivo
- Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy The shell for user ban-  
dit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and  
how to break out of it.
## Datos de acceso
- Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
- Port: 2220
- User: bandit26
- Password: c7GvcKlw9mC7aUQaPx7nwFstuAIBw1o1

## Solución
- When doing the same trick as in the last level, we find ourselves with permissions denied, so it has to be done in a different way. We need to acces to the shell of lvl 26, once, get the password.
```
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell
bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
bandit27-do  text.txt
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do id
uid=11026(bandit26) gid=11026(bandit26) euid=11027(bandit27) groups=11026(bandit26)
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
