# Level 24

## Objetivo
- A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if  
given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no  
way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations,  
called brute-forcing.

## Soluci√≥n
