# Level 24

## Objetivo
- A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if  
given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no  
way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations,  
called brute-forcing.
## Datos de acceso
- Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
- Port: 2220
- User: bandit24
- Password: VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar

## Solución
- Send port 30002 the current password, however this will not give you the next password. Brute force is required, loop the current password until you get the new one.
