## Notas adicionales
- Setuid or Set User ID is a type of file permission setting in Linux operating system that allows a user to execute a file or program using root privileges. This tool is used to elevate a user's privileges, that is, it allows the person running a setuid program to do so as if they were the user who owns the file.
