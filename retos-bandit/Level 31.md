# Level 31

## Objetivo
- There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo`. The password for the user `bandit31-git` is the same as for the user `bandit31`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

## Datos de acceso
- Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
- Port: 2220
- User: bandit31
- Password: OoffzGDlzhAlerFJ2cAiz1D41JW1Mhmt

## SoluciÃ³n
- When you read the README file, you will see instructions on what to do. When I tried to upload the file "key.txt" to the repository, it will show that files with extension txt cannot be uploaded, use "-f" to force this.
